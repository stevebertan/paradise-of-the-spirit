      <blockquote>
        <p>“But unless you repent you will all likewise perish.” (Luke 13:5)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        God created man pure and holy in His image and likeness (Genesis 1:26).
        Because of man’s disobedience to the Creator, he sinned and fell. His
        nature changed and he lost many blessings. He was expelled from the
        paradise where he used to enjoy God’s presence. He lost his peace, his
        joy and his authority over the creation and was left with sin, the
        consequences of which he suffered. Of his own free will, he deprived
        himself from the light and warmth of the Sun of Righteousness.

      <p>
        Before we ride the boat of rescue to go through the sea of repentance on
        our way to the port of salvation, let us pose a very important question:
      </p>
      <p><strong>What is Sin?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Sin, no matter how lightly thought of or considered as trivial, is still
        a transgression and disobedience to God. (James 2:11). Sin is a
        rebellion against God. It is death itself. The Lord Jesus has said that
        the prodigal son, “was dead, and is alive again; and was lost and is
        found.” (Luke 15:32)
      </p>
      <p>
        Sin is weakness, defeat and failure. Man could not control himself but
        instead submitted himself to the authority of sin and its bondage.
      </p>
      <h2 id="what-does-sin-do-to-us-">What Does Sin Do to Us?</h2>
      <h3 id="1-worry-and-loss-of-peace">1. Worry and Loss of Peace</h3>
      <p>
        As a result of his sin, man lost his peace and inherited worry.
        Therefore, worry is associated with sin; man loses his inner peace which
        is God’s best gift and which St. Paul described as the peace which
        surpasses all understanding. (Philippians 4:7) The Prophet Isaiah said,
        <strong
          >“The wicked are like the troubled sea, When it cannot rest,</strong
        >
        Whose waters cast up mire and dirt. “
        <strong>There is no peace,” Says my God, “for the wicked.”</strong>
        (Isaiah 57:20-21) What a description the Prophet gave about the wicked
        that “they cannot rest.” Even if the wicked wants to rest, he cannot;
        for peace is a fruit of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:22) and worry is a
        fruit of sin. There is no fellowship between darkness and light.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >The evil person has an enemy, which bothers him. This enemy is the
          conscience,</strong
        >
        to which our Lord Jesus asked us to agree with. “Agree with your
        adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him.” (Matthew 5:25)
        That was evident in Cain’s life after he had killed his brother. He
        screamed to God saying, “From Your face; I shall be a fugitive and a
        vagabond on the earth, and it will happen that anyone who finds me will
        kill me. And the LORD set a mark on Cain, lest anyone finding him should
        kill him.” (Genesis 4:14) This mark caused Cain’s conscience to bother
        him more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >As long as man is away from God, he is a victim of worry until he
          returns to Him. This is the way God wanted that we should never find
          complete comfort and peace in this world; so we come back to
          Him.</strong
        >
        That is like the dove, which Noah sent out and did not find a
        comfortable place in the world so it returned to the ark. Again when
        Jonah escaped from God, he was in trouble in the sea and could not find
        any way of salvation except by returning to God. He prayed while he was
        in the whale’s belly and God rescued him.
      </p>
      <p>
        We read about many criminals, who after the police fail in arresting
        them, surrender themselves of their own free will and confess their
        crimes even many years later. This is because they prefer to confess and
        be punished rather than hide and be bothered by their conscience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >In fact, there is nothing in the world that takes away our peace
          except sin.</strong
        >
        Job lost his cattle, sheep; camels and all his children, all in one day
        yet his catastrophe was not as great as David’s after he had sinned.
        Job’s temptation could not take away his peace for he said, “Naked I
        came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there. The LORD
        gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.”
        (Job 1:21) But after David had sinned, we hear him saying, “I am weary
        with my groaning; All night I make my bed swim; I drench my couch with
        my tears.” (Psalms 6:6)
      </p>
      <h3 id="2-sorrow-and-distress">2. Sorrow and Distress</h3>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Sorrow and distress accompany sin. Joy is a fruit of the Holy
          Spirit,</strong
        >
        (Galatians 5:22) but sadness is a fruit of sin. When the Israelites were
        in the Babylonian captivity, they sat by the rivers of Babylon
        surrounded by beautiful willows. But all that magnificent nature could
        not make them forget the bitterness of captivity from which they were
        suffering. They mingled the river waters with their tears and instead of
        joyful songs; weeping and crying voices were heard. They hung their
        harps upon the willows, for there is no joy in captivity. “By the rivers
        of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept When we remembered Zion.”
        (Psalms 137:1) This psalm reminds us of the spiritual captivity and
        gives us a picture of the individual who is captured by the devil away
        from Jerusalem, the city of the Great King, (Matthew 5:35) to Babylon,
        the city of adultery. (Revelation 14:8, 18:2) That individual has lost
        his peace and joy saying, “How shall we sing the LORD’s song in a
        foreign land?” (Psalms 137:4)
      </p>
      <h3 id="3-loss-of-hope">3. Loss of Hope</h3>
      <p>
        As we have read, worry, sadness and distress are all fruits of sin.
        These fruits can grow until they reach the point of despair and
        committing suicide.

        <strong>Sin deprives me of my peace with God</strong> and fellowship
        with Him.
        <strong>Moreover, it deprives me of my peace with people.</strong> Love
        is the bond of perfection that binds people together; and sin has the
        opposite effect, for sin in itself is transgression. “Whoever commits
        sin also commits lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.” (1 John 3:4) Sin
        is transgression against God’s commandments and against people too. What
        shall we say about the murderer, the thief and the adulterer? Are not
        their sins considered transgression against others?
      </p>
      <h3 id="5-god-s-wrath">5. God&#39;s Wrath</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Sin brings God&#39;s wrath on people.</strong> God cursed the
        earth which He had created. He told Adam after he had eaten from the
        tree of which he had been forbidden, “Cursed is the ground for your
        sake; In toil shall you eat of it All the days of your life.” (Genesis
        3:17) God burnt Sodom and Gomorrah because of sin and even the
        intercession of Abraham did not succeed in saving them. God destroyed
        the ancient world with the flood because of sin, saving only Noah and
        his family. (2 Peter 2:5-6) Also, God destroyed in one day twenty-three
        thousand Israelites because they had sinned with the Moabites. (1
        Corinthians 10:8) Sin made David cry day and night, wetting his bed with
        his tears.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sin deprives man from God’s help. When Achan, Carmi’s son, sinned, God
        did not help His people and they were defeated in front of the small
        village of Ai in spite of His previous help to them when they conquered
        many nations. (Joshua 7) Sin separates us from God and hence He does not
        hear our cries. “Behold the LORD’s hand is not shortened, That it cannot
        save; Nor His ear heavy, That it cannot hear. But your iniquities have
        separated you from your God; And your sins have hidden His face from
        you. So that He will not hear.” (Isaiah 59:1-2) David also said, “If I
        regard iniquity in my heart, The LORD will not hear.” (Psalms 66:18) Sin
        deprives us of God’s blessings. “Your iniquities have turned these
        things away, And your sins have withheld good things from you.”
        (Jeremiah 5:25)
      </p>

        “Righteousness exalts a nation. But sin is a reproach to any people.”
        (Proverbs 14:34) If you want to know how sound these words are, look at
        the adulterers and the drunk.
        <strong>Moreover, sin can cause diseases to the body</strong> as Jesus
        said in the Bible to the sick man of Bethesda who had been sick for
        thirty-eight years, “See, you have been made whole. Sin no more, lest a
        worse thing come upon you.” (John 5:14)
      </p>
      <h3 id="7-sin-brings-forth-fear">7. Sin Brings Forth Fear</h3>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Man inherits fear and shame from sin, it deprives him of his control
          even over himself,</strong
        >
        and he becomes enslaved to bad habits. He becomes afraid of even trivial
        beings such as weak animals and small insects. That is after he used to
        live in the paradise with wild animals unharmed by them because they
        were all under his dominion. (Genesis 1:26) Man lost this dominion of
        his own free will when he sinned. Consequently, fear entered his life.
        But through repentance, he struggled to reach a state of righteousness
        which Adam enjoyed before he sinned. This explains why many saints were
        able to live with the beasts.
      </p>
      <h2 id="what-does-repentance-do-">What Does Repentance Do?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Repentance is the message of Christianity.</strong> John the
        Baptist, who prepared the way before the Lord Jesus, called the people
        to repentance. (Mark 1:4) The Lord Jesus Himself preached “the Gospel of
        Repentance.” and commanded His disciples to call people to repentance.
        “Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The word <strong>&quot;Metania&quot;</strong> is a Greek word, which
        means repentance. In its original linguistic meaning, it means the
        changing of the heart and the changing of one’s life. Repentance in the
        Orthodox understanding is a new life. St. Paul said, “Therefore if
        anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away;
        behold, all things become new.” (2 Corinthians 5:17)
      </p>
      <p>
        Christianity calls for the renewal of everything and teaches that “No
        man puts a piece of a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Nor do
        people put new wine into old wineskins.” (Matthew 9:16-17) These words
        of the Lord Jesus explain the correct understanding of repentance. It is
        a complete change of the whole life, not just putting a new piece on an
        old garment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many saints have spoken about repentance. They said,
        <strong
          >“It is a reconciliation with the Lord, second baptism, remission of
          sins, and a returning to God.</strong
        >
        It repairs what sin has damaged and builds up what evil has destroyed.
        It renews the heart of the sinner and dresses the wicked with the
        clothes of righteousness. It removes all works of darkness and evil. It
        heels those who are sick with sin. It raises up those who are dead with
        transgressions. It is a sea in which all sins are washed away. It
        attracts those who are living in sin to the kingdom of heaven.”
      </p>
      <p>
        When we sin, we lose our talents, virtues and blessings, and when we
        repent, we get them all back. Penance is an open door to salvation. It
        never closes, for it is God’s compassionate bosom: “The one who comes to
        Me, I will by no means cast out.” (John 6:37)
      </p>
      <p>
        Penance slows God’s wrath. It saved Nineveh’s people after the king,
        men, women and children felt sorry, put on sackcloth and sat in ashes.

        1. The Prophets and Apostles Spoke About God’s Mercy
      </h3>
      <p>
        God’s mercy is the basis for the concept of repentance. Because God
        knows our weak nature, He made this point very clear through His
        continuous promises in the Holy Bible. In the Old Testament, God said to
        His people,
        <strong
          >“The LORD God is merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant
          in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity
          and transgression and sin.”</strong
        >
        (Exodus 34:6-7)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>David praised God for His great and abundant mercy.</strong> In
        one of the psalms, he was so enthusiastic about God’s mercy that he
        said, “Bless the LORD, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless His
        holy name! Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits:
        Who forgives all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases, Who
        crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies.
        <strong
          >The LORD is merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abounding in
          mercy.</strong
        >
        He will not always strive with us, Nor will He keep His anger forever.
        He has not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor punished us
        according to our iniquities. For as the heavens are high above the
        earth, So great is His mercy toward those who fear Him. As far as the
        east is from the west, So far has He removed our transgressions from us.
        As a father pities his children, So the LORD pities those who fear Him,
        For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust.” (Psalms 103)
      </p>
      <p>
        David praised God in another psalm saying, “The LORD is gracious and
        full of compassion, Slow to anger and great in mercy. The LORD is good
        to all, And His tender mercies are over all His works.” (Psalms 145:8-9)
        He said in a third place, “The earth, O LORD, is full of Your mercy.”
        (Psalms 119:64) Also, “For Your lovingkindness is before my eyes.”
        (Psalms 26:3) and
        <strong>“Your lovingkindness is better than life.”</strong> (Psalms
        63:3)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jonah, the prophet,</strong> who warned the people of Nineveh
        that their city would be destroyed because of their sins, became so
        annoyed with God’s mercy that he said, “Ah, LORD, was not this what I
        said when I was still in my country? Therefore, I fled previously to
        Tarshish; for I
        <strong
          >knew that You are a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and
          abundant in lovingkindness, One who relents from doing harm.”</strong
        >
        (Jonah 4:2)
      </p>
      <p>
        God’s great mercy became a subject of meditation for all the saints.
        Jeremiah, the prophet, says, “Through the LORD’s mercies we are not
        consumed, Because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning;
        Great is Your faithfulness.” (Lamentations 3:22-23) He saw and felt
        God’s mercy new every morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        These proclamations are given in the Old Testament.
        <strong
          >For the New Testament, the covenant of grace and salvation is
          predominant.</strong
        >
        The Bible shows God’s great mercy in the free salvation that God offered
        us. God’s salvation is based on God’s mercy because
        <strong
          >without mercy, God would not have redeemed us, “He loved us for no
          reason.” He loved us for his great mercy.</strong
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Zachariah,</strong> being filled with the Holy Spirit,
        prophesied saying, “And you, child, will be called the prophet of the
        Highest; For you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His
        ways, To give knowledge of salvation to His people By the remission of
        their sins, Through the <strong>tender mercy of our God,</strong> With
        which the Dayspring from on high has visited us.” (Luke 1:76- 78)
      </p>
      <p>
        St. Paul said, “But God, who is <strong>rich in mercy,</strong> because
        of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in
        trespasses, made us alive together with Christ.” (Ephesians 2:4-5) He
        also said, “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
        <strong>according to His mercy</strong> He saved us, through the washing
        of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.” (Titus 3:5) St. Peter
        said, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
        according to <strong>His abundant mercy</strong> has begotten us again
        to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
        dead.” (1 Peter 1:3)

        <strong
          >What is the relationship between redemption and God&#39;s
          mercy?</strong
        >
        This relates to the issue of forgiveness in general. For without God’s
        mercy, there would have been no forgiveness and no repentance. I repent
        to receive forgiveness, for if, God does not forgive me, what is the use
        of repentance? Let us, then, eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we
        shall die.
      </p>
      <p>
        How can God forgive my sins? Is there a contradiction to God’s justice,
        which states that “The wages of sin is death?” (Romans 6:23) This could
        have been true if God’s mercy had not interfered. But God’s mercy has
        met God’s justice and that is what David stated,
        <strong>“Mercy and truth are met together;</strong> Righteousness and
        peace have kissed each other.” (Psalms 85:10) God’s mercy did not
        contradict His justice, but it found a solution. That solution is based
        on God’s death to redeem man who sinned. God, who is unlimited takes a
        human body like us to save man who deserves an unlimited punishment
        because he disobeyed God’s commandment. No angel, nor prophet could have
        done this deed of redemption.

        Surely, we can say now that we live in the age of mercy, me. Let us go
        to Him repenting, confessing our sins, believing in the truth of His
        promises that He is opening His arms calling everyone, “Come to Me, all
        you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew
        11:28) “The one who comes to Me, I will by no means cast out.” (John
        6:37)
        <strong>He is ready to forget our sins and never remember them,</strong>
        as the prophet Micah says, “Who is a God like You, Pardoning iniquity
        And passing over the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He
        does not retain His anger forever, Because He delights in mercy. He will
        again have compassion on us, And will subdue our iniquities. You will
        cast our sins Into the depths of the sea.” (Micah 7:18-19)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >How numerous are God’s promises, which encourage us to go to Him
          repenting.</strong
        >
        He promised that He would forget all our sins and make us new creatures.
        The Lord says to us by Ezekiel, “But if a wicked man turns from all his
        sins which he has committed, keeps all My statutes, and does what is
        lawful and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die. None of the
        transgressions which he has committed shall be remembered against him;
        because of the righteousness which he has done, he shall live. “Do I
        have any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?&#39;&#39; says the
        Lord GOD, “and not that he should turn from his ways and live?” But when
        a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity,
        and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does,
        shall he live? All the righteousness which he has done shall not be
        remembered; because of the unfaithfulness of which he is guilty and the
        sin which he has committed, because of them he shall die.” (Ezekiel
        18:21-24)
      </p>
      <p>
        God also says by Isaiah, “Let the wicked forsake his way, And the
        unrighteous man his thoughts; Let him return to the LORD, And He will
        have mercy on him; And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon.”
        (Isaiah 55:7) St. Peter said, “Repent therefore and be converted that
        your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from
        the presence of the Lord.” (Acts 3:19) and “Not willing that any should
        perish but all should come to repentance.” (2 Peter 3:9)
      </p>
      <p>
        All these divine sayings comfort the burdened souls and give rest to the
        troubled hearts. The most important parable which shows God’s great
        mercy to sinners is that of “the Prodigal Son” (Luke 15) St. Luke
        started this chapter saying, “Then all the tax collectors and the
        sinners drew near to Him to hear Him. And the Pharisees and scribes
        murmured saying, “This man receives sinners and eats with them”. (Luke
        15:1-2)
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually the parables which Jesus told, answering the complaints of the
        Pharisees and scribes and showing God’s great love to the sinners are
        three:
        <strong
          >the parable of the lost sheep, the parable of the lost coin, and the
          parable of the prodigal son.</strong
        >
        Each one of them speaks of God’s great love and His abundant compassion
        to sinners to such a great extent that one eventually submits to God’s
        call to repentance and says with Paul before his renewal, “Lord, what do
        you want me to do?” (Acts 9:6) Let us now meditate on the parable of
        <strong>“The Prodigal Son”.</strong>

      <h3 id="4-the-parable-of-the-prodigal-son">
        4. The Parable of the Prodigal Son
      </h3>
      <p>
        The son who left his father’s house is an example of the souls who
        forsake God and His house. That son went to a far off country where he
        wasted his money in riotous living. Then he began to be in need. So he
        worked feeding the swines and he wanted to fill his belly with the husks
        that the swines did eat.
        <strong
          >All this gives us a picture as to what sin and living away from God
          might lead to.</strong
        >
        But as soon as that son felt how bad his situation was, he arose and
        came to his father asking forgiveness. This parable shows us the steps
        toward repentance. The Lord Jesus said regarding that son, “And he arose
        and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his
        father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and
        kissed him.” (Luke 15:20)
      </p>
      <p>
        How explicit this illustration is by which the Lord Jesus wanted to show
        His great love and compassion to sinners. “But when he was yet a great
        way off.” What do these words show us except waiting? The father,
        emotionally moved, waits for his son who had forsaken him and asked for
        the portion of goods that falls to him, without being ashamed of
        himself. If this is the case with the physical father whose life is full
        of weaknesses, how much then of the feelings of the Heavenly Father
        toward His children? He said to us saying, “If you then, being evil,
        know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your
        Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!” (Matthew
        7:11)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >What was the reaction of the father upon seeing his lost son?</strong
        >
        “He had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.” The
        father did all that toward his son even before the son uttered one word
        of apology or proved his sorrow. All these steps are not very
        appropriate for the father. Is not this more appropriate for the son?
        But that is love which forgets all sins. If the physical father showed
        that great love toward his sinful son, how much greater is God’s love
        toward His children whom the devil has enslaved under his authority? He
        is the One Who said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician,
        but those who are sick. For I did come to call the righteous, but
        sinners, to repentance.” (Matthew 9:12-13)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How did the son act toward his father?</strong> While the son
        was in the far off country, he promised himself to apologize to his
        father, saying, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,
        and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of
        your hired servants.” (Luke 15:18-19) However, it happened that when he
        met his father, he uttered those words but the father did not let him
        say the last sentence which is, “Make me as one of your hired servants.”
        This behavior on the part of the father has a very important
        significance in our relationship with God for we never lose our sonship
        to the Heavenly Father, no matter how many sins we may have committed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, our church, through which we become children of God, holds
        that baptism should never be re-administered, even if one denied the
        faith and repented. We should never forget the fact that we are the
        children of God. He paid His precious blood as price for this sonship.
        “Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver
        or gold, from your aimless conduct received by tradition from your
        fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
        blemish and without Spot.” (1 Peter 1:18-19) The expression &quot;Our
        Father&quot; is a beautiful one, which the Lord rejoices in hearing.
        That is why He asked His disciples to use it. “When you pray, say: Our
        Father in heaven.” (Luke 11:2)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >What happened after the lost son apologized and repented?</strong
        >
        The father ordered his servants to “Bring out the best robe and put it
        on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. And bring
        the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry;
        <strong
          >for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is
          found.”</strong
        >
        (Luke 15:22-24) The son became naked by sinning and the father put
        clothes on him. (Genesis 3:7) We might ask ourselves, Does not the older
        son, who spent his life obeying his father, deserve all that? But this
        is the compassion of the father, for the father pities the sick son more
        than the rest of his brothers. Likewise, the Heavenly Father pities the
        spiritually sick more than the ninety-nine who do not need a doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ring put on his hand is a sign of the covenant between the father
        and his son. He does not remember his sins anymore. All that the father
        cared was to cover his son’s nakedness so that he might look like a son
        again, as if he had not done any evil. All that the son offered his
        father were his feelings expressed in some words. But the father
        rewarded him with all his blessings. Likewise in our relationship with
        our Heavenly Father, we need only offer Him our feelings and some words
        and tears, and He will accept us and give us of His abundant richness
        and spiritual gifts to compensate all that we lose by sinning.

        <strong
          >The first step in repentance is to sit with yourself and examine it
          as the Prodigal Son did.</strong
        >
        Think how miserable you are and how you have lost your peace. Tell
        yourself, “How many hired servants of my Heavenly Father have bread
        enough to spare (spiritual gifts) and I perish with hunger
        (spiritually)? How did I lose my happiness, my comfort, my joy and
        peace? What have I gained from my dark life by living in sin? If you are
        frank and sincere with yourself, you will end up in a deep prayer from a
        heart full of shame and eyes full of tears, and you will start beating
        upon your chest in sorrow saying the same words, &quot;Father, I have
        sinned against heaven and before You and am no more worthy to be called
        your son, make me as one of Your hired servants.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Truly, examining oneself is one of the major factors in building up the
        spiritual life. All the saints have talked about its importance. You may
        be ashamed to tell others about what is inside you, and you may not
        accept others to rebuke or direct you, but you are not ashamed of
        yourself when you rebuke it and be strict with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Examining oneself does not consist of looking at the negative factors
          only, that is remembering your sins, but at the positive too, that is,
          the virtues.</strong
        >
        He who does not continuously struggle may be indifferent in his emotions
        toward God; like a flying bird, it cannot go upwards if it does not flap
        its wings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of examining oneself is to overcome one’s mistakes and
        trespasses that one is enslaved to. Remember all the persons,
        circumstances and situations that caused you to sin. Then put the blame
        on yourself for your failings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> If you get nervous frequently, ask yourself:
        Why did I lose my temper when such a person was talking to me? Why did I
        not accept his words with a simple heart? Even if his words frustrated
        me, why did I not endure him like Jesus Who endured all the evil doers?
        Are these insults like the ones Jesus endured? Am I a faithful disciple
        to the Lord who said, “A servant is not greater than his master, nor is
        he who is sent greater than he who sent him.” (John 13:16) The reason
        for losing my temper was my lack of love for that person, that is why I
        did not accept his words with love and I reacted in a rush.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of examining oneself is to find a cure for your sins and to
        be circumspect in your spiritual life. “See then that you walk
        circumspectly.” (Ephesians 5:15)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Remembering our sins is beneficial but we need
        be warned here of something the devil might use to harm us. Sometimes,
        when one remembers his sins, the devil leads one back to the atmosphere
        of sin and excites his emotions. This happens in the case of the
        following sins: lust of the flesh, wrath, hatred and vainglory. Our
        church prays in the Divine Liturgy, “Purify us from all lust, deceit,
        hypocrisy, all evil deeds, and the memory of evil that entails death.”
        As soon as you realize that the devil is fighting you in this respect,
        stop such thoughts immediately. If the devil fights you again, stop this
        method and use a different one.
      </p>
      <p><strong>When Do You Examine Yourself?</strong> The best time is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Immediately after sinning so you would feel sorry and repent right
          away.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the end of the day, so that you may start a new life the next day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before confession in front of the priest, so that your confession may
          be complete.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the end of the week, so on the weekend you might have rest for the
          body and comfort of the soul.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the end of the year: If we had behaved in God’s fear and felt how
          much He helped us during the year, we say thankfully, “You crown the
          year with Your goodness, And Your paths drip with fatness.” (Psalms
          65:11) But if our life had not been acceptable in His eyes, and the
          tree of our life carried only leaves and not fruits, we remember the
          voice crying in the wilderness, “And even now the ax is laid to the
          root of the trees. Therefore, every tree which does not bear good
          fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.” (Matthew 3:10) We
          supplicate the Lord saying, “Sir, let it alone this year also.” (Luke
          13:8)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        St. Gregory the Theologian mentioned that the Christians used to do
        their yearly self- examinations during Epiphany because they renewed the
        covenant, which they had made with God when they were baptized.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>End self-examination with a Prayer:</strong> After you sit with
        yourself to examine it, lift up your heart to God either confessing your
        sins and asking for forgiveness, or thanking Him for His grace and help
        - asking Him to help you to the end. When you examine yourself
        immediately after you committed a sin, lift up your heart to God either
        in sorrow and repentance or in thankfulness even if you are in a public
        crowded place.

        <strong
          >You have to realize that sin insults God, separates you from
          Him,</strong
        >
        deprives you of your peace, and brings God’s wrath upon you. That is why
        the saints used to weep for their sins. David, a great king, used to wet
        his bed with his tears every night because of a sin, which he had
        committed. He, the great Psalmist, said, “My sin is ever before me.”
        (Psalms 51:3)
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes we try to forget our sins and comfort ourselves by outer
        artificial means such as going to a recreational place. Remember your
        sins and cry and repent. Your tears will wash your sins. St. John
        Chrysostom said, “If you remember your sins, God will forget them; but
        if you forget them, God will remember them.”
      </p>

        3. Comfort and Salvation Are Found Only in Jesus
      </h3>
      <p>
        Know that true comfort and perfect joy and peace that passes all
        understanding cannot be obtained except from Jesus Who said,
        <strong
          >“Come to Me all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give
          you rest.”</strong
        >
        (Matthew 11:28) He gave His disciples perfect peace and left to all
        believers a permanent holy gift, “Peace I leave with you, My peace I
        give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you.” (John 14:27)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Be sure that salvation from sin and its dominion is only through
          Jesus Christ,</strong
        >
        by believing in His name, His power, His help, by hoping for His mercy,
        and by using all the means of salvation which the church has laid for
        us. “Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name
        under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12) No
        matter how much you struggle against sin or try to overcome your bad
        habits, you cannot succeed without the help of Jesus Christ Who said,
        “For without Me you can do nothing” (John 15:5)
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, do not depend on your will, your wisdom or your spiritual
        knowledge, but on the strong hand of God. Let God be everything in your
        life and remember the words of the Psalmist, David, “Unless the LORD
        builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless the LORD
        guards the city, The watchman stays awake in vain.” (Psalms 127:1)

      <p>
        You have to realize that the world is “Vanity of vanities, all is
        vanity.” (Ecclesiastes 1:2)
        <strong>Use the world but do not let the world use you.</strong> Live in
        the world but do not let the world live in your heart. Many great people
        and kings departed, but where are they now? If you go to the graves, can
        you distinguish the bones of a king from the bones of an ordinary man?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not let the glory of this vain world distract you from the salvation
        of your soul or tempt you. The devil dared even to tempt Jesus. “He
        showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and said unto Him, “All these
        things will I give You” Jesus said unto him, “Away with you Satan!”
        (Matthew 4:9-10) The glory of this world is compared to a lamp, which
        attracts the beautiful butterflies, which dance merrily around it, but
        soon they fall inside it and are burnt. Remember the parable of the
        foolish rich man who told himself, “Eat, drink and be merry.” The Lord
        told him, “You fool! This night your soul will be required of you” (Luke
        12:19-20)

        Your soul is worth more than the whole world. Jesus said, “For what is a
        man profited, if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or
        what will a man give in exchange for his soul?” (Matthew 16:26) The
        price of your soul is the blood of Jesus Christ, which was shed for your
        salvation. It is pathetic that some people do not care for their souls.
        If their shoes or clothes get dirty, they hurry to clean them, but they
        never care about cleaning their souls and straightening their ways. We
        live now in the age of mercy, but tomorrow you shall be in the age of
        justice. If you insult justice here, you may ask for mercy; but if you
        do not care for mercy here, what will be your status there?

        Beware of doing like the five foolish virgins whom when the bridegroom
        came and found not ready, and the door was shut, they cried in vain,
        “Lord, Lord open to us.” The answer was, “Assuredly, I say to you, I do
        not know you.” (Matthew 25:11-12) Remember also the rich man, who as his
        ground brought forth plentifully, thought of enriching his barns and
        never thought of his salvation. He said to himself, “Soul, you have many
        goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry.”
        (Luke 12:16-20) God’s immediate response was, “You, fool, this night
        your soul shall be required of you.”

        Solomon said, “To everything there is a season, A time for every purpose
        under the heaven.” (Ecclesiastes 3:1) When is then the time for
        repentance? It is not old age, for salt is put on meat to preserve it,
        but what is the use of salt after the meat has been spoiled? It is of no
        use postponing repentance until you get old, after the smell of sin has
        been diffused It is mentioned that one of the skillful photographers
        began drawing the picture of a human being starting from his feet. But
        soon he realized that the space provided was not sufficient to include
        the head, so the picture appeared without the head. Likewise, some
        people postpone repentance, which is the head. Neither a picture without
        a head is expressive nor life without repentance acceptable? One of the
        fathers said, &quot;Repentance is the mother, look after the mother, it
        will produce children.” He meant virtues.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>One might say, “Why not postpone repentance?”</strong> The
        answer is that probably during the period in which you postponed
        repentance, you discover new ways of sinning which you come to like more
        and you might not become enthusiastic about living a holy life any
        longer. How do you know that your eagerness to lead a pure, holy life
        will remain with you in the future? During that period, your ideas and
        outlook on life might change and you might think that it is very hard to
        apply the Christian principles in this world. Again, during that period,

          >Sometimes, when you remember your sins, the devil may lead you to
          despair.</strong
        >
        Look to your Master in His love to sinners. Remember His picture opening
        His arms, calling everyone to comfort, regardless of his sins, to free
        him from the bonds of the devil. Do not be afraid “for you did not
        receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit
        of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.” (Romans 8:15) Ask God
        to grant you repentance. “Restore me, and I will return, For You are the
        LORD my God.” (Jeremiah 31:18)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >The request surely acceptable to God is the request for the salvation
          of your soul.</strong
        >
        This request is according to God’s will as St. Paul says, “For this is
        good and acceptable in the sight of God, our Savior, who desires all men
        to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.” (1 Timothy
        2:3-4) I might make requests to God but He does not answer them as He
        knows that they are not good for my salvation, even when these requests
        were for certain virtues. God knows that such virtues are above my
        spiritual status and will lead me to pride, which God does not want.
        However, God will always accept the prayer for your salvation because
        this is His will. Mar Isaac said, “There is nothing more favorable and
        acceptable in the sight of God than a person praying for the forgiveness
        of his sins.”
      </p>
      <p>
        We have seen one kind of despair. Another kind is the one by which the
        devil tries to complicate God’s way, tempting us with monotony and
        boredom. Nevertheless, we have to know that God’s way is not covered
        with roses. It is enough that Jesus described it as narrow and straight,
        “Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads unto
        life.” (Matthew 7:14) At the beginning of the life of repentance, many
        might retreat. God led the Israelites out of Egypt, but as soon as they
        arrived in the wilderness, they started thinking back of the material
        blessings they had in the land of Egypt. They preferred the garlic they
        ate in the land of bondage to the food of the angels as they were free
        in the wilderness.

      <p>
        <strong
          >In our spiritual life, there is an important principle; the principle
          of “Struggle”:</strong
        >
        do not expect comfort and ease. If this were so, one would have not
        fasted, prayed or struggled in spiritual battles. Jesus said, “The
        kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent takes it by force.”
        (Matthew 11:12) Also, St. Paul said, “You have not yet resisted to
        bloodshed, striving against sin.” (Hebrews 12:4) The more we struggle in
        the life of repentance, the more God’s help is granted to us. Mar Isaac
        said, “As much as one struggles and overcomes himself for the sake of
        God, as much as the divine help surrounds him and makes his struggle
        easy.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >God’s way does not remain that difficult, for God’s promises
          encourage us and His inner voice supports us.</strong
        >
        When God sees our perseverance in overcoming our weaknesses for His
        love, He fights for us and stops all the temptations. St. Macarius, the
        Great, said, “The more one strives for God’s sake, even if he forces
        himself unwillingly to do God’s will, the more chances that one day he
        will do it willingly and happily.” St. Sefemeeky said, “Those who want
        to follow God’s way have to struggle greatly at the beginning and
        eventually they will be very joyful; like the ones who want to start a
        fire, at first their eyes will be full of smoke, but later, they will
        enjoy the fire.

      <h3 id="8-all-sins-can-be-forgiven">8. All Sins Can Be Forgiven</h3>
      <p>
        Every sin, no matter how evil it is, can be forgiven as long as one has
        a sincere intention to repent.
        <strong
          >“Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men,
          and whatever blasphemes they may utter; but</strong
        >
        he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is
        subject to eternal condemnation.” (Mark 3:28-29) Blaspheming against the
        Holy Spirit which is never forgiven is not a sin by itself. It is a
        spiritual condition, which a person reaches. He wants to do evil and
        keeps being stubborn, not listening to the rebukes of the conscience and
        the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is different from committing adultery, killing, or stealing. Any
        person may commit the worst sins or he may even blaspheme against the
        Son of God unbelievingly. St. Paul did that before God renewed his life.
        All this can be forgiven by the influence of the Holy Spirit Who leads
        us to repentance. But he who refuses the work of the Holy Spirit does
        not listen to the voice of his conscience will not be granted the
        forgiveness of his sins forever. He has refused all the means which
        rebuke him. “And when He (the Holy Spirit) has come, He will convict the
        world of sin.” (John 16:8) The Holy Spirit reproves me of my sins.
        Hence, if I refuse His work or blaspheme against Him, I will never
        repent and will never be forgiven.

          one without repentance.”</strong

      <h3 id="9-beware-of-carelessness">9. Beware Of Carelessness</h3>
      <p>
        After having discussed God’s great mercy and His love to sinners and His
        readiness to accept even the worst of them, we now draw your attention
        to an important point: Do not take advantage of God’s great mercy and
        kindness, lest this should lead you to carelessness.
        <strong>God is not only merciful, but He is just as well.</strong> “His
        tender mercies are over all His works” (Psalms 145:9) yet He is still
        just.
      </p>
      <p>
        St. John Chrysostom said, “You who do not believe in eternal punishment,
        tell me who killed with the flood all the people in Noah’s time? Who
        burnt Sodom, Gomorrah, and seven other cities? Who drowned Pharaoh and
        all his soldiers in the Red Sea? Who killed the six hundred thousand
        Jews in the wilderness? Who burnt Abiram? Who ordered the earth to open
        its mouth and swallow Korah, Dathan and Abiram? Who killed seventy
        thousand in David’s time? Who killed eighty-five thousand of the
        Assyrians in one night? Therefore, never take advantage of God’s mercy.
        Remember what Jesus said about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had
        mingled with their sacrifices, and about the eighteen upon whom the
        Tower of Siloam fell, “Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.”
        (Luke 13:3)
      </p>
      <p>
        We live now in the age of mercy, but tomorrow we will be in the age of
        justice and there is a big difference by which God treats people in both
        ages. God was incarnate and granted us eternal redemption; and He is
        coming again in His glory to judge the living and the dead and to reward
        everyone according to his deeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        In His first coming, “He made Himself of no reputation, taking the form
        of a servant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in
        appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point
        of death, even the death of the cross.” (Philippians 2:7-8) In His first
        coming, He came as a shepherd seeking the lost sheep; but in His second
        coming, He will come as a judge, in His glory and the glory of His
        Father surrounded by all the angels and saints.
      </p>
      <p>
        In His first coming, no man shall hear His voice in the streets; a
        bruised reed shall He not break and smoking flax shall He not quench.
        However, in His Second Coming, He will come in His glory with the song
        of the trumpet and the falling of the planets. In His first coming, He
        was long suffering, kind to sinners, did not condemn them, although He
        is the Judge. He even said to the adulterous woman, &quot;Neither do I
        condemn you.” (John 8:11 <strong>)</strong> When a man asked Him for
        dividing the inheritance with brother, He answered, &quot;Man, who made
        Me a judge or an arbitrator over you?” (Luke 12:14) He endured the
        blasphemers, forgave those who insulted Him. However, in His Second
        Coming, He will come as a just judge giving everyone according to his
        deeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        In His first coming, He came as a Bridegroom to Whom we were all
        engaged. He said to everyone in love and meekness, “Listen O daughter,
        Consider and incline your ear, Forget your own people also, and your
        father’s house, So the King will greatly desire your beauty.” (Psalms
        45: 10-11). He compared us to the virgins who are waiting for the
        Bridegroom and He paid His precious blood as an expensive dowry. In His
        Second Coming, He will come as a King conquering the rebellious. He had
        sent apostles and missionaries of peace. The sinners did not listen to
        them and killed them. In the Second Coming, He comes to judge the world.
        “For the hour is coming in the which all who are in the graves will hear
        His voice and shall come forth – those who have done good, to the
        resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection
        of condemnation.&quot; (John 5:28-29)
      </p>
      <p>
        On this day, what will the sinners do? “And the kings of the earth, the
        great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and
        every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the
        mountains, and said to the mountains and rocks: “Fall on us and hide us
        from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the
        Lamb! For the great day of His wrath has come and who is able to stand?”
        (Revelation 6:15-17).
      </p>
      <p>
        But thanks be to God Who is very patient with us and Who gives us a
        chance to repent and bring forth fruits. He lifted the axe kindly on the
        root of the tree and said, “Leave it another year.” Let us all repent
        for the days are evil and let us all wake from our carelessness for the
        day of our life is far spent.

        Virtues Characterizing the Repentant
      </h2>
      <p>
        The life of repentance is a special life which has its own
        characteristics and its virtues which spring out of the repentant’s
        heart. If such virtues do not exist in the life of the repentant, we
        cannot consider him a true repentant. Some virtues are:
      </p>
      <h3 id="1-broken-spirit">1. Broken Spirit</h3>
      <p>
        A repentant is a person who rises up from sin; all his sins and evil
        thoughts are not forgotten but they remind him of his weakness and of
        his evil heart. All his sins remind him of his inability to resist sin,
        the devil, the flesh and the world - all of which are shameful to him.
        Therefore, he develops a broken spirit inwardly and a humble appearance
        outwardly. He is like a person who woke up from his sleep and found
        himself empty in front of God. He has not done a single good deed and
        whenever he looks at his life, he feels so ashamed of himself. His past
        is full of sins and his future is unpredictable - he might fall again as
        he did before.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >A broken spirit and remembering one’s sins are two important matters
          in the life of repentance.</strong
        >
        If one forgets his sins, his broken-spiritedness gradually cools down.
        If one remembers his good deeds, he loses his broken spiritedness. Happy
        is the man who remembers his sins, and keeps them in front of him all
        the time. His tears bring him humility and forgiveness. St. Antony said,
        “If we remember our sins, God will forget them, and if we forget our
        sins, God will remember them.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Two repentant persons with broken spirits are reminding themselves of
        their sins. The first one has led a long life of repentance, forgotten
        his sins but reminds himself of them. His struggles and leads a new life
        and do good deeds. Yet, he keeps reminding himself of them until he goes
        back to his broken-spiritedness. The second person has not forgotten his
        sins. They are constantly in front of him. Neither the time nor the good
        deeds can make him forget his sins. This is what happens to the
        sensitive person with a good conscience. As time goes on and more
        opportunities for growth in the holy life are available, he feels how
        awful and bad his sins are and regrets more having committed them. He
        sees his sins above his good deeds, so he does not remember his good
        deeds but constantly remembers his sins.

          himself of his sins and confesses them to God and prays with

        Blessed is he if he reminds himself of his sins every time people or the
        devil praises him.

        Blessed is he because he never forgets his sins but rather discovers new
        sins in himself daily. Blessed is he because he evaluates himself and
        finds himself still deficient. Whenever he reads about a new virtue or
        commandment in the life of a saint, he tries to train himself to acquire
        it.

      <p>
        <strong
          >Blessed is he who realizes that a broken spirit is a virtue not only
          for beginners in their early life of repentance, but it continues

        St. Paul continued to remember his sins, although it was due to
        ignorance. Even after having been caught up to the third heaven, having
        seen a revelation of the Lord, having heard and seen things which cannot
        be told or uttered, and after many years of performing miracles, he
        still said, “I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be
        called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.” (1
        Corinthians 15:9)
      </p>
      <h3 id="2-tears">2. Tears</h3>
      <p>
        The tears of a repentant are always present. Whenever he stands in front
        of God, he cries. Whenever he remembers his sins, he cries. Moreover,
        whenever he sees others’ sins, he cries. In his quiet time, in his
        readings, in his prayers and sometimes in his talks, his tears are
        always present. The prophet David said, “I am weary with my groaning;
        all night I make my bed swim; I drench my couch with my tears.” (Psalms
        6:6) also, “I have eaten ashes like bread. And mingled my drink with
        weeping.” (Psalms 102:9)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >The tears of the repentant are not tears of fear, but tears of
          sensitivity, tears of sorrow and feeling deficient, tears of a person
          who feels that he has despised his Beloved and made Him sad.</strong
        >
        In spite of the forgiveness of his sins, the sensitive person cannot
        imagine how he did all that to his Beloved and feels very sorry; so, he
        weeps.
      </p>
      <p>
        A person can think before he does any action, and if he does not like
        it, he is free to refuse doing it; but if he has already done the
        action, he is not free to choose. He has nothing to do, if the action
        was wrong, except to weep - the weeping of a crippled who cannot undo a
        wrong action which has already been done. A person can apologize or do a
        good deed to make up for the bad consequences, but he cannot undo the
        action since it has already been done. Then, when all doors are closed,
        the door of tears opens so he enters through it in order that he might
        find some comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The tears of the saints are plentiful.</strong> Some of them are
        tears of love, tears of joy, or tears of emotions, and some are tears of
        repentance. An example of how sensitive a person is in the life of
        repentance is the following story, which St. Bebenouda related about
        himself. He said, “When I was young, I saw a cucumber falling from a
        camel on the ground. I picked it up and ate it. Whenever I remember that
        incident, I weep.” This happened when he was a boy. When he grew up, he
        became a monk, grew in grace, and performed miracles. He succeeded St.
        Macar and became the father of many monks and still whenever he
        remembered that incident, he wept.
      </p>
      <h3 id="3-taking-the-last-seat">3. Taking the Last Seat</h3>
      <p>
        A person with a broken spirit is humble inwardly as well as outwardly
        because his inner feelings are reflected in his behavior. In his inner
        self, he certainly knows that he is a sinner and the worst of all
        people. In his eyes, his sins are the biggest burden and are more than
        the sins of all people. Therefore, he does not condemn anyone and
        whenever he sees any person sinning, he wishes that his own sins were
        that light and not as awful as they are. Hence, he realizes that he is
        the least of all people, he takes the last seat considering himself
        unworthy of even that last seat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever he is invited by God’s blessed people to a meeting, a special
        party or a spiritual gathering, he attends it while he is ashamed of
        himself and he tells himself, “Who am I to sit with those saints?
        Blessed is the Lord who did not reveal my sins to them lest they prevent
        me from attending.” He enters the meeting place and never sits in a
        front seat but rather in the back, still thinking that his presence is
        spoiling the beauty of this gathering. He rebukes himself saying, “Is
        Saul also among the prophets?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever he enters the church, he does it hesitantly and in fear, then
        stands in an unnoticed place while praying, “Let not your anger come on
        this holy place because of me.” In spite of his not sitting in the front
        seat or not daring to enter the altar or to raise his voice, he remains
        in his last seat fearing that any of his old friends might see him and
        wonder about his presence in the church saying, “How could this evil
        person dare enter here?”
      </p>
      <p>
        This last seat accompanies him everywhere and in every behavior. For
        example: if people talk, he remains quiet feeling that he is not worthy
        to talk. If people ask him to give his opinion, he tells himself, “How
        can I give my opinion about good deeds while I am an evil person? It is
        better for me to keep quiet.” If he has to talk, he is the last one to
        talk, saying to himself, &quot;Who am I to talk?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        In his entire behavior, he prefers others to himself, and gets away from
        all opportunities, which give him glory. He respects everyone, big and
        small, considering himself the least of them all. He tells himself, “All
        those people will enter the kingdom of heaven before me, and will be
        better than me if I am worthy to be with them.” He respects even the
        sinners and never condemns them but is kind to them because he has
        experienced sin and has known how severe it is. He feels that all
        sinners are better than himself because they have not fallen to the
        extent he has fallen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >People might say that he is a humble person, but in fact, he does
          behave like that to be humble but because of his feeling of
          unworthiness.</strong
        >
        If people ignore him or neglect him, he does not feel that he is being
        humiliated, but he tells himself, “I have been treated fairly and I do
        not deserve anything except that.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He also forbears others and feels, deeply in his heart, that he deserves
        any insult from others and tells himself, “This was because of my sins.
        Therefore, he is never angry with anyone and says with the right hand
        thief, “We fairly deserve this.” He always blames himself assuring
        himself that his sins are the cause of it all.
      </p>
      <h3 id="4-humility">4. Humility</h3>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Such person, who has a broken spirit, who feels that he deserves all
          blame, is certainly a humble person.</strong
        >
        He can never be proud or praise himself. He never talks of his good
        deeds because he remembers his awful deeds. He does not feel it is right
        to give others a distorted idea about himself by talking about his good
        deeds and not showing his awful sins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever he is tempted to talk about himself or about his new spiritual
        experiences, he says, “Can I tell people about the rest of my life and
        reveal to them my awful sins?” As he refuses to praise himself, he
        refuses to accept praise from others too. He tells himself, “Anyone who
        is a sinner like me does not deserve to be praised by others, or else he
        is a hypocrite who does not show others the truth about himself.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He never excuses himself and does not defend himself even if he is
        unjustly accused. If he is tempted inwardly, he tells himself, “Why do I
        complain when I am accused of an evil deed which I did not do and I did
        not complain when people praise me for virtues I do not possess or good
        deeds which I did not do? Moreover, this evil deed which I am accused of
        is nothing compared to the numerous sins I have committed in my life.
        Even if I am not guilty this time, I did commit sins before, so I fairly
        deserve this accusation.”
      </p>
      <h3 id="5-caution">5. Caution</h3>
      <p>
        A repentant, who has experienced sin and knows its pressure on him and
        his own weakness to overcome it, is very cautious. He fears that he
        might fall again, so he is cautious even with trivial matters because he
        is afraid they might lead into major sins. In his repentance, he never
        thinks he can overcome sin, but always thinks he is weak at overcoming
        the smallest sin; therefore, he escapes from sin and the ways leading to
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This extreme caution is one of the major factors, which made the saints
        never go back to their sins.

        6. Mingling All His Virtues With the Spirit of Repentance
      </h3>
      <p>
        The virtues of the repentant are characterized by a special spirit. They
        are all mingled with a broken spirit and a feeling of unworthiness. For
        example: he fasts not only to bring his body into subjection, but also
        because he feels his unworthiness to eat food. He sometimes tells
        himself, “Many have committed evil sins like mine and are now in prison;
        they do not have the freedom to eat whatever they want and here I am
        free and enjoying food. This is because my sins are not known. Those
        prisoners are better than me because their sins are apparent and they
        have received their due punishment, but my sins are not known and I have
        not received my punishment. The least I do is to deprive myself of
        enjoying food.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This story is about a soldier who repented and became a monk. When
        people tried to honor him, he deserted that place telling himself, “Let
        me go away and eat the food of the beasts since I have committed evil
        sins like the beasts.” This applies not only to fasting but also to
        prayers, tears, etc.

      <h3 id="1-are-there-stages-in-repentance-">
        1. Are There Stages In Repentance?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The repentance of some of the saints, like St. Augustine and St. Moses
        the black, were sudden and perfect because of God’s grace and the
        readiness of their hearts. However, the common procedure is that the
        repentant go through certain stages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The first stage:</strong> Contrition for sin as we discussed
        earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The second stage:</strong> Struggling with sin. When someone is
        sorry for his sins, this does not mean that the devil will not tempt him
        any more. The devil will fight him but all his attempts will fail. The
        devil will try to remind him of his previous sins and his past life. The
        repentant have to be very watchful for all the temptations of the devil
        during this stage. He has to surround himself with a pure environment.
        If he is tempted by sin, he should get away from it. St. Paul called
        this stage, “The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against
        the flesh; and these are contrary to one another.” (Galatians 5:17)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The third stage:</strong> Mental victory over sin. We mean that
        he is convinced that sin, with all its means and ways, is wrong. No
        doubt, this is considered victory for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not mean that the repentant has completely rid himself of sin,
        but there may still be an inner struggle to forsake it from his heart.
        In this stage, the repentant needs certain kinds of struggle and
        spiritual exercises upon which he trains himself under the guidance of
        the spiritual father.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these steps do not mean that the repentant have reached a
        perfection of repentance, for this means the hatred of sin. This is what
        St. Paul said, “Abhor what is evil.” (Romans 12:9)
      </p>

          >Life with God is characterized with joy, while that of repentance, by
          regret and sadnessbecause of sin.</strong
        >
        Is there contradiction between the two?
      </h3>
      <p>
        There is no contradiction between being joyful and being sorrowful in
        the life of the repentant. He is sorrowful but hopeful at the same time.
        He is happy because he is returning to God. Hope is a great Christian
        virtue besides faith and love. (1 Corinthians 13:13) The sorrow of the
        repentant should be mingled with hope and hope produces joy, peace, and
        quietness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The repentant is sad because he feels he has insulted God and has met
        His great love with ingratitude, but at the same time, he put God&#39;s
        promises of accepting the sinners joyfully and that Jesus Christ came
        not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the joy that fills the heart of the repentant is the result of
        his feeling that he has reached God himself, God who has revealed
        Himself to him and has rebuked him on his sins and lit for him the road
        of life. When the repentant reads St. Paul’s words that he was earlier a
        persecutor of the church, and the words, “Where sin abounded, grace
        abounded much more,” (Romans 5:20) he feels embarrassed in front of
        God’s great love and compassion and how he had treated God’s blessings
        with his sins. Therefore, his eyes are filled with tears, that of a
        broken heart from God’s great love, and that of joy for His wonderful
        salvation.

        David looked at a woman who was bathing and his heart was filled with
        lust and he could not resist sin. Sin enslaved him without pity and made
        him fall in two terrible crimes: the sins of adultery and killing.
        However, God’s great mercy interfered and sent him Nathan, the prophet,
        to rebuke him. David then confessed his sin in humility and with a
        broken heart. God accepted his true repentance by forgiving him. Nathan
        told David, “The LORD has put away your sin; you shall not die.” (2

        One day, while he was walking in the Nitria Valley, probably escaping

        bored from his life of robbery and murder so his heart was open to the
        words of the saint. He decided to repent and stay in the wilderness of
        Sheheat. He longed for the monastic life, so he went to his spiritual
        father, St. Isidoros, and confessed his sins. He struggled in his
        ascetic life. He was very harsh on himself, trying to make up for what
        had passed from his life in sin and evil. Even his spiritual guide used
        to advise him to be less severe in his struggle. Many became his
        disciples and he was well known all over the wilderness. His body lies

        atheist teachers, he started forgetting the principles of religion. In
        addition, his reading of many books by atheist philosophers influenced
        his life greatly until he deviated and indulged in adultery. After he
        repented, he said, “I used to be ashamed of not doing evil.” However,
        his righteous mother did not stop praying with tears for him. When St.

        and ministry of the Word and Church. He was ordained a priest, then a
        bishop of one of the cities of North Africa and became one of the

        heretics. He became an authority in the Christian dogma in his
        generation. His numerous books are in our hands. In one of his famous
        books, “Confessions,” we read his excellent phrase, “Lord, You have

        She was born in the town of “Menouf” in Egypt, from rich, righteous
        parents. She followed their example in righteousness. When they died,
        she made her house a refuge for strangers and the needy. She spent all
        her money on the poor. However, some evil people influenced her to
        change her house into a house of prostitution. The elders of Sheheat
        heard about her and were very sad, so they sent St. John the Short to
        her. As soon as he saw her, he said, “Why did you insult your Lord Jesus
        Christ and bring this evil matter to your house?” She was troubled from
        his words and her heart was touched.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then St. John looked to the ground and started weeping. She asked him,
        “Why do you weep?” He told her, “Because I see the devils playing on
        your face.” She asked him, “Can I repent?” He said, “Yes, but not in
        this place.” She answered, “Take me wherever you want.” She hurried
        after him until they entered the wilderness. When it was dark, he told
        her, “You stay here,” and he went farther away from her.

        She left her father’s house at the age of twelve to live in sin and evil
        in the city of Alexandria. She lived seventeen years in adultery. One
        day she saw a ship sailing to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of the
        Cross. She went on just to satisfy her dirty lusts.
      </p>

        In Jerusalem, she tried to enter the church to receive a blessing from

        worshipping God in the wilderness. Then she was able to enter the church
        and receive the blessing from the holy cross.

        She left this church and went to another where she confessed to the

        47 years, worshipping God very piously fighting the devil who was

        out of that place. Then St. Mary took him to the Paradise where he saw
        the saints shining. St. Mary started pointing at the saints, saying:
        “This is our father Abraham, this is David the Prophet, this is St.
        Antony, etc. He noticed that the saints were sitting on strange lighted
        chairs. One of these chairs was empty. He asked surprisingly, “Who left
        his chair empty?” St. Mary answered him, “This is your chair if you
        follow Jesus Christ.”

        He woke up determined to repent and to reach that chair which was

        worked in the government and stayed there until he departed at a young
        age. God was glorified in his short life by many miracles. Many saw a

        day if you do not keep them? You have heard what the Lord said to His
        disciples, “He, who hears from you, hears from Me. He who does not hear

        call the righteous, but sinners to repent.” (Mark 2:17) These are not my
        sayings, but they are the Lord’s sayings, so why do you neglect your
        life? If you know that your thoughts and deeds are evil, why do you keep
        hiding your wounds? From whom are you afraid? From the Physician? He is
        not severe nor without mercy. He does not use a bitter medicine because
        he cures by mere words. If you want to come to Him, He is full of
        compassion and kindness. He came for you from the Father’s bosom. He was
        incarnated for you, so you may proceed to Him without fear. He became a
        man for you to cure your hidden wounds. By His great love, He calls you,
        “O sinner, come and be cured easily. Remove the burden of your sins.”
        Supplicate God with tears, for this Good Heavenly Physician cures your
        wounds by tears and prayers! Do you know what hour the Heavenly

        O friend, until when are you going to serve the carnal desires and be

        Listen to my advice and you will live. Purify your soul and body.
        Proceed to the Savior with a fervent repentance. Get away from the
        scorpion that bit you. Flee the serpent that you have experienced its
        poison for he, whose feet stumble twice, are blind and cannot see what
        should be avoided. Look at Nineveh, which was full of sin, how God had
        ordered its destruction. However, when He saw the people wearing ashes
        and ashes, in hunger, fasting and weeping, he had compassion on them,
        forgave them, and saved them. He preferred to go back in His words
        rather than to punish them.”

          >O great mercy, how abundant you are! O Lord, can anyone not marvel
          from Your mercy? Can anyone not confess Your Grace? You came that we
          be born from the womb of repentance as You were born from the Blessed
          Virgin Mary Your mother.</strong

        We have lived in evil and wickedness but repentance can purify and
        enlighten us.

        Adam can bear children from Eve, which resemble the physical world.
        Likewise, Jesus, from baptism and repentance, can bear children who
        resemble the spiritual world. He says to us, “Repent, for the kingdom of
        Heaven is at hand.” How can we find repentance if it is close?

        Christ calls everyone to repent, but the devil prevents people from
        hearing that calling. Repentance saves those who are captives to sin.

        <strong>Repentance changes adulterers to celibates.</strong> It is fire,
        which burns the weeds. It is the water for the holy plants. It is the
        intercessor of the captives.
        <strong
          >Who is he who does not love you, O repentance; you carry all the
          blessings? Only the devil hates you for you have taken away his
          wealth, properties and made him empty from his inheritance which he
          once plundered.</strong

        No one who puts his hope in you ever fails. No one ascended to heaven
        without you. Who can see God without repentance? Who repented and did
        not reap the fruits of joy? Who did not wipe his face with the tears of
        repentance and did not see God in his heart? You have saved David from
        sin and the people of Nineveh, even after God’s judgement on them.

        Blessed are you O mother of forgiveness (Repentance). God has granted
        repentance to be the intercessor of sinners. God will never close His
        door if you ask Him, for He has given you the keys of the kingdom.

      <h2 id="a-prayer-for-repentance">A Prayer for Repentance</h2>
      <p>By Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite</p>
      <p>
        O God, forgive me, I am a sinner, for I cannot raise my eyes up to You
        because I am ashamed of my many sins. O God, forgive my sins and have
        mercy on me in Your kingdom. My Lord, I supplicate You and ask You for
        my wretched soul and body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lord, grant me to do Your will and let Your mercy guide me. My Lord and
        God, forgive my sins and hide my iniquities, save me from Your wrath and
        anger. What shall I say when I come between Your hand and what will
        justify me when You judge me? Lord Jesus, direct and shield me from the
        snares of the devil. Place Your peace and Your Holy Name in me, O Lord
        Who dwells in Heaven, so Your mercy might come and shield me. Do not
        deliver me in the hands of the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have put all my worries on You, Jesus, Son of God, do not leave me. If
        I lean towards evil, do not forsake me and do not let me walk according
        to my evil desires. Do not delay rebuking me until the day of judgement.
        Do not punish me according to my sins. Cover the shame of my nakedness
        before Your fearful throne. Purify me, so I will not be defiled when I
        come before Your hands. O God, Lover of mankind, fortify my soul with
        Your precious blood. Lord, subdue my desire to sin by Your fear. Awaken
        me from the slumber of negligence that springs out of the sin. Keep me
        from going astray and the slip of my lips.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let Your angel expel the blasphemies of sin. Prepare me so Your Holy
        Spirit might find me a temple for Him. Grant O Lord, my soul and spirit
        to praise You all the days of my life. Answer me O Lord according to
        Your great mercy and accept my prayer and supplication. Save me from
        sinning against You and grant me the way to do Your will. Do not take
        away Your blessings from me and do not keep me away from Your help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep me a holy temple for You. Purify my heart, tongue and all my
        senses. Take away from me the stony heart and grant me a contrite one to
        worship You. Do not refuse me, for You have called me. Have mercy on me,
        You Who have the authority to grant mercy. Make me worthy to praise You
        all the time until my last breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confirm Your holy words in my heart and soul. Save me from all the
        snares of the evil one. Direct my life to the way it pleases You. Have
        mercy on me and listen to my cry. Answer my supplication and accept my
        prayer. Accept my prayer and do not keep away Your mercy from me. Let my
        prayer reach Your presence. Listen to my voice and let my cries come to
        You. Let my prayer be upright before You as the aroma of sweet incense
        in Your Hands. Do not judge Your servant for no one is faultless before
        You. For Yours is the kingdom, the power, and the Glory, forever. Amen.

        A Prayer to Decide Living with God
      </h2>
      <p>
        O Holy Father, Who does not wish anyone to perish but all to repent, I
        thank You for Your long suffering with my many sins and for bringing me
        to this hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        How many times I promised to live in Your obedience, and not to insult
        Your holy name but I broke my promise and went against Your
        commandments.
      </p>
      <p>
        O merciful Lord Who made known His great love for the sinners in Your
        Son our Lord Jesus Christ, grant me the blessing to please You and to
        live in Your obedience to the end. Strengthen me, my God, for I am weak
        before my many enemies surrounding me. Lord, You know everything, You
        know that I love You, although my love is lukewarm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lord, I find no peace away from You, no rest except in living with You.
        There is no security or permanence for anything in this world for all
        pass away. Blessed are You O Lord Who is faithful in Your love and who
        does not change.
      </p>
      <p>
        O Heavenly Father, in my weakness, naughtiness, and reckless thinking, I
        put myself into Your hands confident of Your protection, believing that
        You are capable of keeping me until the end. Seal, O God, my covenant
        with Your blessings and keep me undefiled until Your second coming for
        Yours is the Glory from now and forever. Amen.
